                    Rasmus Hojlund proved Erik ten Hag's two-word verdict right on Manchester United debut.

                </h1>
                <h2 >Man Utd were beaten by Arsenal on Sunday but it was a promising debut for Â£72million striker Rasmus Hojlund at the Emirates.</h2>
                <p id="rasmus2">Erik ten Hag felt two words would do the job. In a press conference dominated by discussion around Rasmus Hojlund ahead of his Manchester United debut, Ten Hag was asked about the mentality of the 20-year-old about to pull on one of the heaviest shirts in world football.

United did their due diligence on Hojlund's personality as well as his abilities and since his arrival in the first week of August, Ten Hag has had the chance to get to know the Dane who now carries the burden of being the man United's goalscoring hopes are pinned on.
So what is his mentality like, the inquisitor wanted to know. "He's brave," Ten Hag said, with the kind of confidence and forcefulness that we've come to expect when he has a point to get across.<br>

Anything else? "He is brave, he has belief and the rest will come." It was a fascinating answer about a player United acknowledge as a rough diamond that Ten Hag will need to polish.
