        <p>Manchester United unveiled their bold away kit for the 2023/24 season on Monday and it certainly attracted some attention.<br>

            The base colour of the shirt is green with white stripes and maroon lines. It's drawn a mixed reaction from supporters despite the nod to United's history, with others worried that the design is a little too eccentric.<br>
            As you'd expect, the shirt has gone down well in the United dressing room. The club released a behind-the-scenes video of the kit photoshoot with several first-team players outlining what they like about the new kit. They gathered the thoughts of Diogo Dalot, Fred and Facundo Pellistri, who all highlighted the unique design as a major draw.

"Yeah, I really like it, I like the way it's been done," Pellistri said. "It's quite original and different. I like it."<br>
            "Yes we love it, these colours, it looks different and we know about the history," Fred added.<br>

            <p id="p2">Dalot is hoping that the new stripes will bring extra points in the Premier League. He said: " Feels nice, feel fresh with this new kit. I like it. I think it will bring us wins and that is the most important," he joked.<br>
    United have already confirmed when the kit will be debuted. A youthful United side will take on Wrexham at the Snapdragon Stadium in San Diego in the early hours of Wednesday morning, and that will be the first opportunity for fans to see the kit in action.
